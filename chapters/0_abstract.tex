%There are a lot of search engines, systems and projects out there that have the objective %of answering natural language questions. Some of them serve as a general-purpose %technology for processing data and answering natural language questions on these data and %others are some new type of content-aware search engines that convert speech to written %text and further to structured data. Usually, these systems are capable of answering a %wide range of different topics starting from daily life questions and ending with more %complicated questions that might relate to sensitive topics such as military, armed forces %or even intelligence services. Basically, the more general a technology is, the wider is %the range of potential uses. The information required to answer such questions may be %available in different places and in several forms. Some of these forms are general %knowledge collections, such as Wikipedia, special databases, articles and much more.
