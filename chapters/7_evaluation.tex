\section{Experiments and Results}
To evaluate the proposed solution, firstly, it was tested against standard test cases, secondly, it was compared against XTurtle framework, lastly, it was validate with arbitrary large RDF files. This chapter discusses all of such details in the following text. 


\subsection{Testing with RDF SuiteTest}
The evaluation phase finds its starting point at \citealp{TurtleTests:Online} where Test Suite files of Turtle serialization are found. Any new parser (focused on the same RDF serialization) can its proficiency be validated against these files.
