\section{Conclusion}
This chapter concludes this study. Mainly, the focus was to detect all syntax errors in RDF input .  

\section{ Future Work}
The semantic web is rapidly developed, by introducing new tools, apps, plugins, can be of different programming language. As well, there are several RDF serialization  formats have same shortage of fault-tolerant parser. Since it a very wide and an open research field, a couple of ideas come to our mind which can be our next step in the future. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introducing parsers for mostly used programming languages. 
    \item Providing parsers to support the different RDF serialization formats.
    \item Developing to advanced parsers which parsing process in distributed manner.
\end{itemize}
